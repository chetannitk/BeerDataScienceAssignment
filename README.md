 ## Steps to Run:
---------------------------------
    - Create environment using conda or venv with python 3.6
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - All the notebooks are present in notebooks folder.
    - There are 4 notebooks. First notebooks can be run locally and all others notebooks should be run 
       in google colab because of higher computation.
